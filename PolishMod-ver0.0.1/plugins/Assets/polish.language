"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/1", "Do they love you? Do they fear you?"
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/2", "The nights are getting longer. The monsters grow more fierce. Tell me, how does another deal sound? I promise to make it worth your while."
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/3", "I have something of great value. Something that is one of a kind. No matter how hard you look, you will not find this item again."
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/4", "And all I want in return is… well, it’s nothing really. Nothing at all."
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/5", "A simple choice - two measly Followers. Or if that causes you unease, then how about… half of a heart from the great Leader themselves? A fair equivalent, I think."
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/6", "Come now, a great Leader must make sacrifices. Two pathetic little Followers, or a pound of your own flesh?"
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting2/Answer_B/0", "You disappoint me, Lamb. I thought better of you."

"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting3/2", "One last deal."
"Conversation_NPC/Fox/Meeting3/3", "I will give you something more coveted than anything else in this world or the next. Something folks have fought for, killed for, lost their minds for - and it will be yours."
